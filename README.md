# Otter
Another twitter clone using Django

Otter will start off as a frontend for twitter with an end goal
of becoming an independent microblogging platform.

`make` to get started

Uses Python and virtual environments to keep things :sparkles:clean:sparkles:.

`source .venv/bin/activate` to enter the virtual environment and `deactivate` to leave it.

`pip freeze > requirements.txt` to update changes to pip package dependencies.

`python manage.py runserver` to start the development server.
